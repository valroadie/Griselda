About Griselda
===========================

Griselda is an ever lasting work in progress, though it has been lifted from the ashes at version 0.0.1 it will continue to grow. 
You may edit as needed, you may complain as needed, no I will not buy you a box of tissues to clean your tears from the frustration of this distro.

You may burn as many witches as you please. 

Witch Griselda version 0.0.1 has come to fruition yet it, as with everything, needs work.
